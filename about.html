        <P>Hello, my name is Ethan Albers and I am a prospective Code Fellow - Code 301 student creating a webpage to
            demonstrate my capabilities and showcase my ability to complete the tasks learned in Code 201.</P>
        <p>I am 25 years old and just got out of the military this past November. I am from Dayton, OH but my parents
            and
            siblings all live in Erie, CO. I have two years of experience in coding from my time pursuing a computer
            science
            engineering degree at Ohio State University.</p>
